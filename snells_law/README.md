# 🌈 Geometric Optics: Snell's Law Simulator

This project is a Python-based simulator for **Geometric Optics**, specifically focusing on **Snell's Law**. It calculates and visualizes how light refracts (bends) when passing from one medium to another (e.g., Air to Water).

---

## 🔬 The Physics Behind It

Snell's Law describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction:

$$n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)$$

This simulator handles:
- **Angle Calculation:** Using `numpy.arcsin` to find the output angle.
- **Total Internal Reflection:** Logic to detect when light cannot pass through the interface.
- **Vector Visualization:** 2D plotting of incident and refracted rays.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**: For trigonometric calculations and vector handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating the geometric graphs.
